**FLOW**
- Chair is in idle mode
- During idle mode each chair has its unique solid colour 
- The proximity sensor is checking if there is a head, if no head is detected it should return around ~53
- If a head is detected the voice plays the following prerecorded message: "Welcome... Relax and look at the camera"
- The colour of the light fades to white to increase the quality of the captured image and stays white for 4 sec during the capture and processing of the image.
- The picture after it has been analysed on the server, it seeds the text generation
- The colour turns back to the signature chair colour and goes into 'breathing mode'
- The voice announces "Photo acquired, please enjoy..." 
- 2 sec pause and then it starts playing back the generated content
- Text is generated vocalised and played back through the chair speakers
- When the user leaves the chair the sound stops and the light becomes solid again
